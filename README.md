# RokuCast
Cast videos from chrome to roku

Comprised of a modified vGet extension and modified firefox cast app.

Credits to original authors and mozilla foundation for their hard work, without which this mod could not be possible

## Installation

Create a zip file from the contents of the "Firefox Receiver Mod" folder.

You should not be zipping the folder "Firefox Receiver Mod" itself. Instead, navigate inside that folder and create a zip file containing "images, json, source, manifest".

Upload that zip file through roku dev mode.

-----

Install the vGet extension in google chrome by going to chrome -> preferences -> extensions and dragging/dropping the .crx file into that window. 

## Usage

Once installed, navigate to any site containing html5 content [this site](https://people.mozilla.org/~mfinkle/casting/test.html) for example, and you will see a brown download icon appear in the URL bar. Click on that, select the video to cast, and enter the IP address for your roku.

## Bugs/Todo:

Currently does not support YouTube

Requires manual entry of roku ip address
