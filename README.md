# RokuCast
Cast videos from chrome to roku


Requires 2 things:

Modified vGet extension for chrome & modified firefox cast app

Both are available from this repo

Credits to original authors for their hard work, without which this mod could not be possible


------

Sideload the firefox receiver app to the roku by zipping the contents of the folder (NOT THE FOLDER ITSELF) and uploading via dev mode (instructions for sideloading are available on web).

vGet extension can be installed via crx from chrome.
