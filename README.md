# RokuCast
Cast videos from chrome to roku

Comprised of a modified vGet extension and modified firefox cast app.

Credits to original authors and mozilla foundation for their hard work, without which this mod could not be possible

------

## Installation

Create a zip file from the contents of the "Firefox Receiver Mod" folder.

You should not be zipping the folder "Firefox Receiver Mod" itself. Instead, navigate inside that folder and create a zip file containing "images, json, source, manifest".

Upload that zip file through roku dev mode.

vGet extension can be installed via crx from chrome.
